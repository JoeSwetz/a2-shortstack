A2 Test Task
===
You've played a few games of your favorite FPS game, and 
you've decided that you want to play competetively against
other players. You open the FPS stat calculator and you
want to get some stats about your performance from the past
couple of games.

1.) You've played five games and you want to enter the 
following stats:
	Game1: 5 kills, 6 assists, 2 deaths
	Game2: 0 kills, 8 assists, 3 deaths
	Game3: 3 kills, 1 assist, 5 deaths
	Game4: 10 kills, 0 assists, 2 deaths
	Game5: 3 kills, 4 assists, 6 deaths

2.) You realized you made a typo on Game3 and need to 
correct it. Modify the Game3 stats to: 10 kills, 5 assists, 
3 deaths.

3.) You're not happy with your performance in Game2 and want
to erase it off the face of this Earth. :( Delete Game2 from the
table of stats.

4.) You now see your stats on the screen. Numbers, however, are too
much work and you decide to look at some graphs. Download the table
data as a csv file and open it in excel. Verify the data is the
same as the data in the tables.

Test 1
===
1.) Participant Last Name: Hunt	
2.) What problems did the user have with your design?
	An error occurred that result in the values in that table being null,
	I acknowledged this out loud, not thinking it would interrupt the test. 
	The user then said they didn't even see the totals and averages table
	at the bottom of the UI.
3.) What comments did they make that surprised you?
	When modifying a row of stats, they said they were going to leave fields
	that they didn't want changed empty (so they wanted to modify assist, so they
	left the "# kills" and "# deaths" fields of the form empty). This was not
	actually supported.
4.) What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
	I would move the table that displays totals and averages somewhere else, probably
	higher up on the screen so the user sees it when they see the other table.
